        As the lead developer for the National Earthquake Alerts Centre, I am responsible for
        software systems that produce, store and disseminate information associated with earthquakes
        and other seismic events. I have:

          - Continuously maintained and enhanced the earthquake alerts and analysis system, which is
            a mix of open-source, proprietary and bespoke software deployed on **AWS** using
            **Terraform**.
          - Architected and developed a custom data catalogue for the storage, quality control, and
            dissemination of earthquake-related data products of all kinds &mdash; from raw
            seismograms through to news articles.  I built this system using **Python** on
            **AWS**, with geospatial indexing powered by **PostgreSQL/PostGIS** and an interactive
            frontend built on Web Components.
          - Integrated the USGS ShakeMap modelling software into our semi-automated workflow,
            allowing the Centre to rapidly estimate and visualize the areas most effected by an
            earthquake.  I worked with geoscientists to tailor the configuration to Australian
            seismology, and added several new features to the ShakeMap software to meet our
            requirements, which I subsequently contributed back to the USGS repository.
          - Developed pipelines to ingest, transform and integrate various data sources.
          - Performed statistical and geospatial data analysis to support reporting and decision
            making by the NEAC's operations and science leadership.

        A fixed-term position at the *High Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre* developing software
        for agriculture and plant science.
        My main focus was developing infrastructure to exploit time series data gathered from sensor
        networks:

          - Reworked data ingest processes and set up a new storage and aggregation solution
            using **InfluxDB**.
          - Implemented a HTTP API to manage and retrieve time series data and metadata.
          - Designed and developed a web dashboard on top of this API to provide diagnostics and
            basic data visualization. Used **JavaScript**, including the visualization libraries
            **D3.js** and **Plotly.js** along with modern web standards (**HTML5**, **SVG**,
            **CSS3** transitions, **ES** modules, **Web Components**, etc.).

        Most of this work was integrated into an existing web application built on a
        **Linux**+**Apache**+**SQLite**+**PHP** stack.
        I also contributed to other projects, including a REST microservice built in
        **Java**/**Spring** and deployed using **Docker**.

        Design and full-stack development of web applications & administration of associated
        systems and databases.

        I worked on various large web applications, mostly built on **Linux**+**Apache**+**Perl** and backed by
        **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**. The tools we used changed over the years, but **DBIx::Class**
        and **HTML::Mason** were mainstays.  On the frontend, I used JavaScript to create
        interactive user experiences.

        Many of these applications were business systems systems that interfaced with older
        proprietary software; so I became proficient in systems integration and data
        munging/wrangling/ETL.

        I was also involved in developing simple deployment architecture and scheduled
        processing/reporting/backup tasks; so I have extensive experience using shell scripts, cron
        jobs and daemons to automate systems.

          **PhD Thesis:** 
          [*Geometric Flows of Diffeomorphisms*](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/142453)  
          **Supervisor:** Ben Andrews  
          Geometric flows hijack what we know about the physics of heat flow to study geometry: by
          making a mathematical analogy between "spikiness" and heat, we can deform
          poorly-understood spiky objects to simple smooth ones; and by understanding the
          mathematical properties of this deformation we can derive new knowledge about the spiky
          things we started with. In my thesis research, I applied this methodology to a previously
          unstudied class of flow.

          **Majors:** Mathematics, Physics  
          **Honours Thesis:** *The Riemannian Penrose Inequality and the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow*  
          **Supervisor:** Gilbert Weinstein  
          The universe should weigh at least as much as the biggest black hole it contains, but the
          mathematical embodiment of this fact (the Penrose Inequality) is remarkably difficult to
          derive from general relativity: it took until 1999 for even a special case to be proven.
          This thesis was an exposition of the problem and its solution intended for a slightly less
          expert audience.

        - Interactive Media: as a spin-off from my thesis research, I combined
        numerical simulations of partial differential equations with my expertise in frontend web
        development to develop interactive visualizations of some geometric flows, which you can
        play with online at 
        [a.carapetis.com/csf/](https://a.carapetis.com/csf/) (**TypeScript** + **Canvas**) and 
        [a.carapetis.com/diff_flow/](https://a.carapetis.com/diff_flow/) (**PixiJS**).
        - My professional history has been concentrated on a few languages, but I have hobbyist
        experience with many others, including **Ruby**, **C++**, **TypeScript** and **Haskell**.
        - Graphic design (hobbyist, volunteer and freelance projects) using **Inkscape** and
        **GIMP**.
