# CV
This is my CV. It's written in plain HTML and CSS. I've handcrafted the
[CSS styles](./style.css) so that the same document looks good in print and on any
screen - try it on your phone!

It also compiles to PDF using playwright - you can build it by running `npm install && npm run build`.

This repository also includes a [GitHub Actions workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yml) which compiles the CV to PDF format and [publishes it to GitHub Pages](https://acarapetis.github.io/cv/).
