# CV
This is my CV, intended to be compiled to pdf using [ReLaXed](https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed).

After running `npm install`, run `npm start` to start the development server, which will recompile cv.pdf every time cv.pug changes. To compile the PDF as a once-off, use `npm run-script build`.
