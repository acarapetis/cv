                  The National Earthquake Alerts Centre (NEAC) operates highly-available software systems that detect
              earthquakes and disseminate the resulting information. I am the lead developer on a small team responsible
              for maintaining and enhancing these systems, providing architectural guidance and fostering a culture of
              code review and continual improvement.

                  <li>
                    Led an overhaul of our infrastructure management and DevOps practices, allowing us to quickly
                    provision functional copies of our system, e.g. for training or automated testing, on
                    <b>AWS</b> using <b>Terraform</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developed a custom data platform for the quality control, storage, discovery and dissemination of
                    earthquake-related data of all kinds. Built on
                    <b>Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy</b>, <b>PostgreSQL/PostGIS</b>,

                    model into our system, allowing the NEAC to rapidly estimate and visualize the areas most effected
                    by an earthquake. I worked with geoscientists to tailor the configuration to Australian seismology,
                    and added several new features to the ShakeMap software to meet our requirements, which I
                    subsequently contributed back to the USGS repository.

                    performance, identified and fixed bugs, enhanced statistical models, replaced closed-source code
                    with

                  <em>High Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre</em> developing software for agriculture and plant science.
                  My main focus was developing infrastructure to exploit time series data gathered from sensor networks:

                    Designed and developed a web dashboard on top of this API to provide diagnostics and basic data
                    visualization.

                  <b>Supervisor:</b> Ben Andrews.<br>
                  Geometric flows hijack what we know about the physics of
                  heat flow to study geometry: by making a mathematical analogy between &quot;spikiness&quot; and heat,
                  we can deform poorly-understood spiky objects to simple smooth ones; and by understanding the
                  mathematical properties of this deformation we can derive new knowledge about the spiky things we
                  started with. In my thesis research, I applied this methodology to a previously unstudied class of
                  flow.

                  The universe should weigh at least as much as the
                  biggest black hole it contains, but the mathematical embodiment of this fact (the Penrose Inequality)
                  is remarkably difficult to derive from general relativity: it took until 1999 for even a special case
                  to be proven. This thesis was an exposition of the problem and its solution intended for a slightly
                  less expert audience.
